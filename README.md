A Christmas themed Breakout JavaFX game 

# Gameplay Instructions

To play "Present Sleigher" aka "Breakout", first press ENTER to start.
Pressing the UP arrow on the keyboard will serve the ball (elf head)
into the field. Using the LEFT and RIGHT arrows,you can move the paddle
(sleigh) to move to the ball and hit it back into the field. You want to
clear the field of all the presents to move on to the next level. Each
present has 4 states: unopened, slightly opened, opened, and dead. When
the present hits the dead state, you are awarded a point. You are given
3 lives. If the ball falls below the sleigh, you lose a life. If you make
it to the next level, you gain a life. Press the UP arrow to reserve your
ball if you died or went to the next level. If you lose all of your lives,
game over. There are a total of 3 levels, each increasing by the ball speed
and a row of presents. If you make through all 3 levels, you win!
