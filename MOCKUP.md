# Present Sleigher Images

![Start of Game](http://i.imgur.com/KjRru3J.png)
This is the start of the game. Santa and his reindeer
fly across the screen and the press ENTER flashes red
and green

![During Game](http://i.imgur.com/D0y2XRP.png)
This is the game in play. The broken presents are slightly
open and the very broke presents are open with a bear coming
out

This is for when you get to go to the next level. It is telling
you to push up to go on while displaying your current score

![Game Over](http://i.imgur.com/ZNaHUMd.png)
This is when the game is over. It tells you your score.



# Design
These images do not show the graphics implements in my GUI. On the start screen,
Santa flys across and the press Enter messages flashes. When continuing into the
game, the presents very realistically open and a teddy bear pops out as you continue
to "open" the presents. The next level and game over look how they will display. These
scenes just display text that informs you of what is going on or what has already happened.
